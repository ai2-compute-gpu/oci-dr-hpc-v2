# Dr-HPC Test Limits

## Overview
**Dr-HPC** uses the `test_limits` package (`test_limits.json`) to determine test configurations and thresholds for various HPC shapes.

## Purpose
The `test_limits` package provides the following key information:
- **Test Enablement:** Determines whether a specific test is enabled for a given shape.
- **Thresholds and Limits:** Defines the acceptable thresholds or performance limits for each test within a shape.
- **Test Categorization:** Specifies the category each test belongs to for better organization and reporting.

## File Reference
- **Configuration File:** `test_limits.json`

## Notes
Ensure that the `test_limits.json` file is up-to-date to accurately reflect the supported shapes, thresholds, and test categories.
